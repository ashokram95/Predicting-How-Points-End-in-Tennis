# Predicting-How-Points-End-in-Tennis
CrowdANALYTIX's Data Science Competition

Predicting How Points End in Tennis was a competition hosted on CrowdAnalytix. This was also my first data science competition, so I spent a lot of time learning and exploring different algorithms to get a feel about how each algorithm worked. The goal of the compeittion was to predict how the point ended: winner, unforced error, or forced error. The model I settled on was XGBoost, which is the go-to algorithm among Kagglers.
